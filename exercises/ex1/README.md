# Exercise 1 - Get Started with Grounding

In this exercise, we'll start exploring the grounding on SAP AI Core. Grounding allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to reference specific knowledge sources when generating responses, which can help improve accuracy and relevance. 

We'll start with the basics by grounding an LLM using SAP.help as our knowledge source. 

This exercise will cover:

* Basic grounding concepts in SAP AI Core
* How to set up grounding with a document source
* Comparing responses with and without grounding

For this excercise continue in Visual Code.
